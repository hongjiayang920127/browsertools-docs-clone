We welcome contributions to BrowserTools MCP! This guide will help you understand the project architecture and how to contribute effectively.

## Project Overview

BrowserTools MCP consists of two main components:

1. **Browser Extension**: Interacts with web pages and provides access to DOM elements, console logs, and network requests.
2. **Local Server**: Acts as a bridge between the browser extension and AI assistants or other tools.

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp.git
cd browser-tools-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client (Browser Extension)**: 
  - Injects scripts into web pages
  - Captures DOM events, console logs, and network requests
  - Communicates with the local server via WebSockets

- **Server**:
  - Provides an API for external tools to interact with the browser
  - Manages connections to browser extensions
  - Processes and formats data from the browser
