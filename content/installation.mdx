## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

### Common Issues & Errors

1. **Port already in use**

   If you see an error like "Port 3000 is already in use", you can specify a different port:

   ```bash
   npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server --port 3001
   ```

2. **Permission denied**

   If you encounter permission issues, try running the command with administrator privileges or using sudo (on Linux/macOS).

3. **Connection issues**

   If the browser extension cannot connect to the server, make sure:
   - The server is running
   - Your firewall is not blocking the connection
   - You're using the correct URL
